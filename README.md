# IA07
IA07 Assignment for CMSC434. 

Based off of tutorial from 

http://code.tutsplus.com/series/create-a-drawing-app-on-android--cms-704

Which I did use some code verbatim from.

Also Uses 

https://github.com/chiralcode/Android-Color-Picker/
as a completly self contained package, in com.chiralcode.colorpicker

I also consulted the android developers guide and stack overflow.

# To Run:

* Draw with your finger
* Erase and Trace are both toggle options that turn erasing or tracing on and off. 
* Brush brings up an option panel to modify the brush size and opacity. 
* The left side button shows the current color. Click on it to bring up the color selection.
